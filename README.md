## Installation

1) Rick click [this](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3aw0wpm9gie0nt7/sorry.ps1?dl=1) and run with powershell

2) Open OBS: Settings > Stream > Service > Show All > Sorry Video

3) Select Server Region (Id recommend US-WEST if similar ping)

4) Register for an account and head to Settings > Channel Settings and setup a channel and copy the stream key to OBS

## Connectivity Testing

You can ping both servers if you would like to see where you have a better ping.

US-WEST= us-west.sorry.video
US-EAST= us-east.sorry.video
